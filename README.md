* Array.Sort()    // using System;
* dict.ContainsKey()//using System.Collections.Generic;
* when you want to know isFirstBool, try to set the first value instead of this bool. e.g. max of array, set the max value as arr[0] and start the loop.
* using System.Linq;
* IList<IList<int>> ans = new List<IList<int>>();
* To remove the last of n index from the linked list, use two pointer method. Pointer 1: current(starts from head to tail), Pointer 2: current - n-th node https://leetcode.com/problems/3sum/
* System.Collections.Generic; Stack<int>, Push, Pop, Peek, Count 
* To avoid null check for linked list, we can use dummy. Dummy will have any value. Whenever we find new element, we will add it to dummy.next. When we need to return the ans, use dummy.next. https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-two-sorted-lists/submissions/
